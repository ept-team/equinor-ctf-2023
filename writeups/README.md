# EPT CTF 2022 - Writeups
This is a repo collecting writeups from players for the challenges to the EPT CTF 2022.

We want **YOU!** to submit your writeups as pull requests to this repo to gather everything in one place, instead of a messy #writeups channel on Discord.

## Structure
This repositoriy follows the following structure:
```
Category > Challenge Name >
 - README.md - Contains challenge name and description.
 - <files> - Any files provided by the challenge will be listed here
 Team name >
   - README.md
   - solve.py
   - <any other solve files needed>
```
So we have already provided a list of categories and challenges. Each challenge directory will contain a README.md with the challenge description and name. Any files provided by the challenge will be in the directory as well.

## Submitting your writeup
We then want you to submit your writeups in a folder with your team name. There you are free to add a README.md explaining your solution and any other solve scripts or files used to solve the challenge.

Please see the example write-up provided by the EPT team inside [here](./Stego/Reversing/ept/README.md).

Submit one writeup per Pull Request to the repository. Simply put, create a fork of the repository and create a pull request from your fork. These resources might be usefull:
